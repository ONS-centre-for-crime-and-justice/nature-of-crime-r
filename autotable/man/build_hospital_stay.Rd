project) or inspect a valid YAML file from previous successful runs.

#'@param master_config A string corresponding to a folder path whereat the VF datasets for each year are stored as .csv
files.

#'@param subtable An integer indicating which subtable to consider; if we denote the value of \code{subtable} by \code{n},
then the subtable considered will be that corresponding to the \code{n}th item in
